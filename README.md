# Project12780

Welcome to the project I created for my class in web development. This class focused on the basics of writing web apps using Django and Javascript, and was light on how to make things look good with CSS and HTML. 

To run the project, you can download the entire repository. Then navigate to the folder location in a terminal, and type `python manage.py runserver`.

It should start a server for you that will show the website running. It includes instructions on how to use it on the website.
